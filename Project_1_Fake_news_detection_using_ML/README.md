ðŸ“„ Fake News Detection
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can classify news articles as Fake or True based on their content.
It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text preprocessing and a classification model to detect fake news.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset consists of two CSV files:

Fake.csv â€“ Collection of fake news articles.

True.csv â€“ Collection of true/real news articles.

Dataset Source: Fake News Dataset on Kaggle

Each dataset contains news title, text, and subject. A new binary column Fake is created for labeling:

1 â†’ Fake News

0 â†’ True News

ðŸ›  Features
Text Preprocessing:

Lowercasing text

Removing punctuation & special characters

Removing stopwords

Tokenization

Model Training & Evaluation:

Train-test split

Vectorization (CountVectorizer / TF-IDF)

Classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes)

Accuracy & classification report

ðŸ“Š Results
The trained model achieves strong accuracy in distinguishing between fake and true news, as demonstrated in the classification metrics.

ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements
Experiment with deep learning models (LSTM, BERT)

Deploy as a web app with Flask or Streamlit

Perform hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy
